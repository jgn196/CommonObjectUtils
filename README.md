CommonObjectUtils
=================

A .Net class library to make writing common object methods quicker and more consistent.

Currently the project provides the following support classes (that have been partially 
ported or inspired by the corresponding classes in the Apache Commons project):

* EqualsBuilder
* HashCodeBuilder
* ToStringBuilder

In addition, the project also contains the following classes to support common object unit testing:

* EqualsTester
* ErrorTester

For more detailed information see the [Project Help Pages](http://jgn196.github.io/CommonObjectUtils).

If you prefer you can build the help pages from the CommonObjectUtilsHelp Visual Studio help project in the solution. 
This requires the Sandcastle tools.

The library targets .NET 4.
